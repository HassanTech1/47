<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a premium fashion store website for the 7777 brand.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Stack**: Originally requested Node.js, Express, EJS, GSAP, but the agent is using the environment's default React/FastAPI stack.
- **Header**: Transparent, blurs on scroll, with a centered logo ٧٧٧٧ and icons for search, user account, cart, and wishlist.
- **Hero Section**: A key feature with complex animations. The initial idea was a diagonal split screen that animates on scroll. This has evolved significantly to feature two 3D models that animate and reveal text. The user has provided many iterative feedback points on this section.
- **Collections & Categories**: Sections for Bags, Jackets, Shirts, Pants with hover effects.
- **Promo Banner**: A cinematic image with the text: حقيبتك عليك وملابسك علينا.. صيفك يكتمل معنا.
- **Summer Product Grid**: A 12-product grid (4 columns, 3 rows).
- **Lifestyle Section**: Featuring a man and woman in identical outfits.
- **Footer**: Centered logo, 3-4 columns with links for navigation, customer care, social media, and a newsletter signup.
- **Floating Elements**: A WhatsApp-style chat button that appears after scrolling past the hero section.
- **General**: Full RTL support for Arabic, responsive design, and a premium aesthetic inspired by provided links. The font style was also requested to be changed.

**User's preferred language**: Arabic (العربية). The user communicates primarily in Arabic, though sometimes mixes in English. The next agent MUST respond in Arabic.

**what currently exists?**
A frontend-only React application has been created with mock data. Key components built include the , , , , , and . The  is the most complex part, featuring a split-screen layout (red and black) with two 3D models ( files rendered using Three.js/react-three-fiber) and two buttons. The overall theme is black and white, with red accents in the hero section. GSAP is used for animations.

**Last working item**:
The user provided a batch of significant UI update requests for almost every section of the page in the last few messages. The agent acknowledged all of them but did not get to implement them. The last action was acknowledging the footer update request.

- **Last item agent was working**: Acknowledging a full-page redesign requested by the user, including updates to the header, categories, summer collection, lifestyle section, and footer.
- **Status**: NOT STARTED
- **Agent Testing Done**: N
- **Which testing method agent to use?**: screenshot tool
- **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- **Issue 1 (P0)**: Implement the batch of UI changes requested by the user in messages #179, #182, #184, #188, and #192.

**Issues Detail**:
- **Issue 1: Full-page UI overhaul required**
    - **Description**: The user has requested specific design changes for the Header, Categories, Summer Collection, Coordinated Outfits section, and Footer, providing visual references. The current UI does not reflect these latest requests.
    - **Attempted fixes**: The agent acknowledged the requests but has not yet attempted to implement them.
    - **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  Modify : Make the menu smaller, add text labels (Account, Basket, Search) next to the icons, and reduce font sizes as per user feedback in message #179.
        2.  Modify : Update the section to display shirts, jeans, and hoodies with prices, matching the style from message #182.
        3.  Modify : Re-style the product grid and implement a click-to-preview image carousel for each item, as per the design in message #184.
        4.  Modify : Replace the current image with the one provided in message #188 for the Coordinated Outfits section.
        5.  Modify : Rebuild the footer to match the new minimalist style shown in message #192.
    - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: To align the application's design with the user's latest vision and make progress on the project.
    - **Status**: NOT STARTED
    - **Is recurring issue?**: N
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: frontend
    - **Blocked on other issue**: None

**In progress Task List**:
- **Task 1: Complete UI Overhaul**
    - **Description**: This task covers the implementation of all pending UI changes from the issue list above.
    - **Where to resume**: Start by modifying  and proceed sequentially through the other components (, , etc.).
    - **What will be achieved with this?**: The application's frontend will match the user's most recent design specifications.
    - **Status**: NOT STARTED
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: frontend
    - **Blocked on something**: None

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks**:
    - **(P1) Floating Chat Button**: Implement the WhatsApp-style chat button that fades in after the user scrolls past the hero section, as per the original requirements.
- **Future Tasks**:
    - **(P0) Backend Development**: Implement the FastAPI backend, create MongoDB models for products, users, etc., and build the necessary API endpoints.
    - **(P0) Frontend-Backend Integration**: Replace all mock data in the React components with data fetched from the backend API.
    - **(P1) User Authentication**: Implement user registration and login functionality.
    - **(P1) E-commerce Functionality**: Implement add to cart, wishlist, and the full checkout flow.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Frontend Scaffolding**: Created the initial React project structure with multiple components.
- **3D Model Integration**: Successfully integrated Three.js (via  and ) to load and display user-provided  3D models. Solved CORS issues by serving models locally.
- **Hero Section Iteration**: Went through numerous design cycles for the hero section, implementing and changing:
    - A split-screen (red/black) layout.
    - Positioning, coloring, and animating the 3D models.
    - Adding and positioning FOR HIM / FOR HER style buttons.
    - Adjusting animations from scroll-based rotation to a static floating effect based on user feedback.
- **Theming**: Changed the website's color scheme from a gold-based theme to a black-and-white theme.
- **Component Creation**: Built initial versions of , , , , , , , and .
- **PRD Creation**: Created .

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- The hero section's scroll animation and overall feel has been a consistent point of iteration. While the agent has made many changes, the user has repeatedly asked for adjustments. The current static float is the latest stable version, but the agent should be prepared for more feedback on this.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS
- **Animation**: GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)
- **3D Rendering**: Three.js, react-three-fiber, react-three-drei
- **Styling**: CSS, Inline Styles, Tailwind CSS

**key DB schema**
- N/A (Backend not implemented)

**changes in tech stack**
- The project is being built with a React frontend and a planned FastAPI backend, instead of the user's initially mentioned Node.js/Express/EJS stack. The user agreed to proceed with defaults.

**All files of reference**
- : Contains the complex logic for the split-screen layout, 3D models, and animations.
- : Reusable component for rendering the  models.
- : Main application component, orchestrates the layout of all sections.
-  & : Contain global and specific styles, including theme colors and hero section styling.
- : Directory created to host 3D model files locally to avoid CORS errors.
- : Project Requirements Document.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The CSS is fragmented across , , and inline styles within components. Consolidating styles, perhaps using CSS modules or a more organized Tailwind approach, would improve maintainability.
-  has undergone many changes and likely contains commented-out code and complex animation logic that could be simplified now that the user prefers a more static effect.

**key api endpoints**
- N/A

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- The user provides frequent, highly specific visual feedback, often with reference images. Expect to work in short, iterative cycles of implementing design changes and showing the results.
- The user's primary language is Arabic. All communication MUST be in Arabic.
- The hero section is the most critical and sensitive part of the design for the user. Pay close attention to feedback on the 3D models, their placement, and animations.
- The entire application is currently a frontend prototype. The next major phase will be backend development and integration.
